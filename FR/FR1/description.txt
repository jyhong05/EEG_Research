This dataset contains behavioral events and intracranial electrophysiological recordings from a delayed free recall task. 
The experiment consists of participants studying a list of words, presented visually one at a time, 
completing simple arithmetic problems that function as a distractor, 
and then freely recalling the words from the just-presented list in any order.
